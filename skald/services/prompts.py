RERANK_PROMPT = """\
You are a strict reranking function.

INPUTS YOU WILL RECEIVE (JSON):
- "query": string
- "documents": array of strings (candidate documents)

TASK:
For each document, assign a relevance score in the closed interval [0.0, 1.0] indicating how relevant it is to the query.
Higher is more relevant. Consider semantic meaning, factual alignment with the query, and usefulness to answer the query.

RULES:
- Return a single JSON object with this EXACT schema:
  {{
    "results": [
      {{"index": <int, original index in input array>,
       "document": <string, the original document text verbatim>,
       "relevance_score": <float between 0.0 and 1.0> }}
    ],
    "total_tokens": null
  }}
- The "results" array MUST be sorted by "relevance_score" in descending order.
- Use only the keys shown above; DO NOT include any extra keys.
- "index" MUST map to the original position of the document in the input list.
- "document" MUST be returned verbatim (do not edit).
- "relevance_score" MUST be a float in [0.0, 1.0] (use up to 6 decimal places as needed).
- "total_tokens" must be set to null. (A calling wrapper will replace it with an actual integer.)
- Output ONLY valid JSON. No comments, no trailing text.

Now wait for the JSON block with "query" and "documents".
