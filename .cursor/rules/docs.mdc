# Documentation generation

- Always follow the same tone and patterns as existing documentation
- Keep docs very concise and to the point
- Whenever you make changes (or spot changes) to:
    - services: update README.md to include the most up-to-date running instructions
    - the API's structural components: like changes to auth, update api-overview.md
    - API endpoints: update api-reference.md
    - models: update models.md

# Using the docs

- Refer to the docs/ directory for overviews on how things work
