# Codebase styles and patterns

## General

- Write very concise and simple code. 
- Avoid very complex patterns.

## Frontend

- Store state in Zustand stores, following the patterns found in the stores/ directory. Only use useState when the state is 100% component-specific.
- Use the api.ts util for all API requests.
- Build using modular components that make sense as independent units. 
- Do not create files with multiple components, unless there is a main component and a very small supporting component that won't be used elsewhere.

## Backend

- Follow existing API patterns from xxxx_api.py files when creating new endpoints.
- Make sure endpoints are secure.
- Ensure everything has static types.
