# Busan

Busan (Korean: 부산; pronounced [pusan]), officially Busan Metropolitan City, is South Korea's second most populous city after Seoul, with a population of over 3.3 million as of 2024. Formerly romanized as Pusan, it is the economic, cultural and educational center of southeastern South Korea, with its port being South Korea's busiest and the sixth-busiest in the world. The surrounding "Southeastern Maritime Industrial Region" (including Ulsan, South Gyeongsang, Daegu, and part of North Gyeongsang and South Jeolla) is South Korea's largest industrial area. The large volumes of port traffic and urban population in excess of 1 million makes Busan a Large-Port metropolis using the Southampton System of Port-City classification. As of 2025, Busan Port is the primary port in Korea and the world's sixth-largest container port.
Busan is divided into 15 major administrative districts and a single county, together housing a population of approximately 3.6 million. The full metropolitan area, the Southeastern Maritime Industrial Region, has a population of approximately 8 million. The most densely built-up areas of the city are situated in a number of narrow valleys between the Nakdong and the Suyeong Rivers, with mountains separating most of the districts. The Nakdong River is Korea's longest river and Busan's Haeundae Beach is also the country's largest.
Busan is a center for international conventions, hosting an APEC summit in 2005. It is also a center for sports tournaments in Korea, having hosted the 2002 Asian Games and FIFA World Cup. It is home to the world's largest department store, the Shinsegae Centum City. Busan was added to the UNESCO Creative Cities Network as a "City of Film" in December 2014.


== Names ==
The name "Busan" is the Revised Romanization of the city's Korean name since the late 15th century. It officially replaced the earlier McCune–Reischauer romanization Pusan in 2000. During the Japanese colonial period, the Japanese reading of the city's name was "Fuzan".
The name 釜山 (now written 부산 using the Korean alphabet) is Sino-Korean for "Cauldron Mountain", believed to be a former name of Mt Hwangnyeong (Korean: 황령산; Hanja: 荒嶺山; RR: Hwangnyeongsan) west of the city center. The area's ancient state Mt Geochil (거칠산국; 居柒山國; Geochilsan-guk, "Rough-Mountain Land") is similarly thought to refer to the same mountain, which towers over the town's harbor on the Suyeong (the later Silla district of Geochilsan-gun was renamed Dongnae in 757).


== History ==
The area that Busan now occupies was inhabited during the Neolithic period. Artifacts dating to this period discovered near the coast include stone tools, pottery, sea shells, and animal bones. Fishing was a primary food source for people of this period. Bronze Age artifacts have been uncovered further inland. By this period, agriculture was being practiced.
Around the first century, a chiefdom called Koch'ilsan-guk (거칠산국; 居漆山國) existed around what is now Dongnae District. At some point, it was absorbed by Silla and made an administrative division called Koch'ilsan-gun (거칠산군; 居漆山郡). In 757, it was renamed Dongnae-gun (동래군). In 835, the Buddhist temple Beomeosa was founded in the area.
In the Goryeo period (918–1392), the local Dongnae Jeong clan became a prominent presence in Korean politics. By this point, Dongnae's hot springs became famous, and have been attested to in writings of this period. By the end of the period, raids from wokou (Japanese pirates) intensified. One such invasion occurred in 1396. To defend against this, the fortress Dongnaeeupseong was established in the area.
In 1423, the port of Busan (부산포) and a waegwan (Japanese concession community) were established. During the reign of King Sejong the Great (r. 1418–1450), the population in Dongnae-hyeon was reportedly 2,416 people in 290 households. In Dongpyeong-hyeon, it was 627 people in 108 households. The waegwan was closed in 1510, but reopened in 1512.
During the 1592–1598 Japanese invasions of Korea, various fortresses in the area defended Busan against the invasion. Fortresses included Busanjinseong, Dadaeposeong, and Dongnaeeupseong. Civilians formed righteous armies (volunteer militias) and joined in the fight. After the siege and capture of Busanjin in 1592, most of Busanjin's Korean prisoners and civilians were massacred. After the war, diplomatic relations with the new shogunate in Japan were established in 1607, and Busan was permitted to be reconstructed.
In 1605, the shrine Songgongsa was built to honor those who died defending Korea during the invasions. The shrine was dubbed Chungnyeolsa in 1624. In 1607, a waegwan was reestablished in Dumopo (두모포; 豆毛浦); in 1678 it was moved to Choryang (초량; 草梁; now around Yongdusan). In 1763, Busan became the first place in Korea to have sweet potatoes, which arrived from Tsushima Island in Japan. In 1759, the population was reportedly 25,753 people in 6,657 households.
In 1876, Busan became the first international port in Korea under the terms of the Treaty of Ganghwa. In 1877, a concession was established in Busan, and consulates of Japan, Qing, and the United Kingdom were established. In 1883, the port was opened, and a Busan Customs Office (부산해관; 釜山海關) was established. In 1895, Dongnae-bu was made part of South Gyeongsang Province. It was demoted to a gun in 1903, and made a bu again in 1906. After the beginning of the 1910–1945 Japanese colonial period, in 1914 it was made a gun again. In 1908, Busan was connected to the Gyeongbu Line via Busan station. In 1909, a ferry service was opened between Busan and Shimonoseki in Japan. In 1914, Dongnae-bu was reorganized into Busan-bu. In 1915, a tram was opened between Busanjin and the Dongnae Hot Springs. The following year, the city tram opened.
During the Japanese rule, Busan developed into a hub trading port with Japan. Busan was the only city in Korea to adopt the steam tramway before electrification was introduced in 1924.
During the Korean War, Busan was one of only two cities in South Korea not captured by the North Korean army within the first three months of the war, the other being Daegu. As a result, the cities became refugee camp sites for Koreans during the war. According to The Korea Times, around 500,000 refugees were located in Busan in early 1951.
As Busan was one of the few areas in Korea that remained under the control of South Korea throughout the Korean War, for some time it served as a de facto  capital of South Korea. UN troops established a defensive perimeter around the city known as the Pusan Perimeter in the summer and fall of 1950. Since then, the city has been a self-governing metropolis and has built a strong urban character.
In 1963, Busan separated from South Gyeongsang Province to become the first Directly Governed City of South Korea. In 1983, the provincial capital of Gyeongsangnam-do was moved from Busan to Changwon.


== Geography ==
Busan is located on the southeastern tip of the Korean Peninsula. It is located on the coast, which determined the development of the whole city itself. The distance from Busan to Seoul is about 314 km (195 mi). Busan borders low mountains to the north and west, and the Korea Strait to the south and east. The Nakdong River Delta is located on the west side of the city, and Geumjeongsan, the highest mountain in the city, is on the north. The Nakdong River, South Korea's longest river, flows through the west and empties into the Korea Strait. The southeastern region, called Yeongnam in Korea, encompasses both Gyeongsang Provinces and 3 metropolitan cities of Busan, Daegu and Ulsan. Ulsan lies northeast of Busan. The combined population exceeds 13 million.
The closest overseas area to Busan is Tsushima, Japan, with a distance of about 49.5 km (30.8 mi). The closest Japanese mainland area to Busan is Fukuoka, roughly 180 km (112 miles) away. Busan and Fukuoka are also sister cities.


=== Climate ===

Located on the southeasternmost tip of the Korean Peninsula, Busan has a cooler version of a humid subtropical climate, bordering on a subtropical monsoon climate influenced by East Asian monsoon (Köppen: Cfa, bordering on Cwa). Extremely high or low temperatures are rare. The highest temperature ever recorded is 37.3 °C (99.1 °F) on 14 August 2016, while the lowest temperature ever recorded is −14.0 °C (6.8 °F) on 13 January 1915. May to July, late spring and early summer, are usually cooler than inland regions because of the ocean effect. Late summer, and early fall, August, and September, are generally hot and humid and the city may experience typhoons at that time and be generally rainy. On September 15, 1959, Super Typhoon Sarah passed by the coast of the city and caused catastrophic damage. An unusually severe storm on September 12, 2003, Typhoon Maemi, also caused damage to ships and buildings and resulted in over 48 fatalities. Typhoon Hinnamnor on September 6, 2022, caused destruction in Busan as a category 2, producing high waves, destructive winds, and flooding. Busan is the most prone city in South Korea to typhoons and other natural disasters.
October and November are generally the most comfortable, with clear skies and pleasant temperatures. Winters are cool and comparatively dry with high winds, but much milder than other parts of Korea, except Jeju Province and several islands off the southern coast. Busan and the nearby area have the least snow compared to other regions of Korea due to its location. Snow falls on an average of only about 4 days per year.


=== Administrative divisions ===
In 1957, Busan adopted a division system with the creation of six gu (districts): Busanjin District, Dong  District, Dongnae District, Jung District, Seo District, and Yeongdo District. Today, Busan has divided into fifteen gu and one gun (county).


== Economy ==

Busan is the second largest city in Korea, a maritime logistics hub in Northeast Asia with its world-class mega ports, and a gateway to the Eurasian continent. In 2022, the maritime city recorded a GRDP of KRW 104 trillion with a per capita GRDP of KRW 39.6 million. The city's economy is made up of the service industry (70.3%), manufacturing (19.8%), construction (5.9%), agriculture & fisheries (0.8%), and other sectors (3.2%).
As the sixth largest port in the world, the port of Busan processed 21.81 million TEU of container cargo volume in 2020. The port's container terminal has 43 berths - 20 berths at the North Port, and 23 berths at the Busan New Port (including 2 multi-purpose berths). The port is part of the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road that runs from the Chinese coast to Singapore, towards the southern tip of India to Mombasa, from there through the Red Sea via the Suez Canal to the Mediterranean, there to the Upper Adriatic region to the northern Italian hub of Trieste with its connections to Central Europe and the North Sea.
Moreover, the city is a center of marine science and R&D, and home to a number of relevant institutions, such as the Korea Maritime Institute (KMI), the Korea Institute of Ocean Science and Technology (KIOST), the National Fishery Products Quality Management Service, the Korea Hydrographic and Oceanographic Agency (KHOA), and the Korea National Maritime Museum, located in Dongsam Innovation Complex in Yeongdo District. Moreover, the International Federation of Freight Forwarders Associations (FIATA) World Congress was hosted in Busan in 2020.
The city is also known for its global MICE (Meetings, Incentives, Conferences, and Exhibitions) industry. The city's convention and exhibition zone have excellent conditions and infrastructure to host large-scale international events, which includes BEXCO in Centum City, Nurimaru APEC House, and hotels nearby natural environments. Major international conferences in Busan include the 2005 APEC Economic Leaders' Meeting, ASEAN–Republic of Korea Commemorative Summit 2014, and 2018 African Development Bank Group Annual Meetings.
Busan is also a center of finance. Korea Exchange (KRX), Korea's sole securities exchange operator, is headquartered in Busan. The city is home to a number of financial institutions, such as the Korea Technology Finance Corporation, Korea Asset Management Corporation, Korea Housing-Finance Corporation, Korea Housing & Urban Guarantee Corporation, Korea Securities Depository, Korea Maritime Guarantee Insurance, Maritime Finance Center, The Korea Shipping and Maritime Transportation Co., Ltd, Korea Asset Management Corporation, and BNK Financial Group. 

Commercial areas are dispersed throughout the city near busy intersections and adjacent to university campuses, but the two largest central business districts in Busan are Seomyeon and Gwangbok-dong/Nampo-dong. There are four major shopping areas: Seomyeon, Gwangbok-dong, Busan Daehak-ga in Jangjeon-dong, and Centum City in Haeundae District.
Seomyeon Station is one of the busiest subway stations in Korea; it is the transfer station between Busan Subway Line 1 and Line 2. Seomyeon subway station is also home to a large number of underground stores, selling a variety of products, predominantly clothing, and footwear. These are small stores selling locally produced products. The local head offices of Korean and international banks are located in Seomyeon. It is recognized as the ascendant shopping and entertainment district. It is also home to "Seomyeon Medical Street", the district encompassing the 1 km-radius range around Lotte Department Store in Seomyeon and the Buam subway station. The Street is home to a total of 160 cosmetic and other medical clinics, including those specializing in cosmetic surgery, dermatology, ophthalmology and dentistry. Directly adjacent to Seomyeon is Bujeon Market, the largest traditional market in the city.

The Gwangbok-dong, Nampo-dong, and Jungang-dong areas form the old central business district. Some of the restaurants in this district use family recipes passed down through the generations. Jagalchi Market, a large seafood market, is located in this area. The Gukje Market is also nearby. Jungang-dong is the home of many international law offices, the old immigration office, and the international ferry terminal serving Japanese routes.

Busan is called the summer capital of Korea since it attracts tourists from all over the country to its six beaches. Luxury hotels and a carnival boardwalk line the beach at Haeundae. Gwangalli Beach has cafés, bars, and restaurants along the beach, and the Grand Gwangan Bridge. Other beaches include Dadaepo Beach on the west edge of the city and Songdo Beach, south of central Busan.
Haeundae Beach is Busan's most famous beach. It is a staple setting for South Korean films and TV shows, such as the 2009 film Tidal Wave. Dongbaekseom is located at the southern end of Haeundae Beach. This island is picturesque with a thick forest of camellias and pine trees. Tourist attractions on Dongbaek Island include a walking path and the Nurimaru APEC House, built for the 2005 APEC summit. Songjeong beach is the next beach north of Haeundae Beach.
Geumjeongsan to the west is a weekend hiking spot for Busan residents. To the north, the neighborhoods around Pusan National University (also known as PNU, which is one of the most highly recognized national institutes of higher education in Korea) have student theaters, cafés, bars, and restaurants, as well as open-air cultural street performances on weekend nights. Nearby is Beomeosa, the city's main Korean Buddhist temple.

Yongdusan Park occupies 69,000m²/17 acres (7 ha) and is home to the Busan Tower, Yongdusan Art Gallery, and the Busan Aquarium, the largest aquarium in South Korea. The park supports approximately seventy different species of trees and is a tourist destination, with various cultural events throughout the year.
Dongnae District is a wealthy and traditional residential area. Dongnae Oncheon is a natural spa area with many baths, tourist hotels, restaurants, clubs, and shopping areas. Many restaurants in the area use family recipes. Chungnyeolsa is a Confucian shrine for soldiers who died during the 16th-century battle against the Japanese at Dongnae Fortress.
Taejongdae is a natural park with cliffs facing the open sea on the island of Yeongdo.

The area known as the "Foreigners' Shopping Street", but commonly referred to as "Texas Street" near part of the Port of Busan, and adjacent to the front entrance to the Busan Train Station (부산역) has many businesses that cater to the local Russian population, as well as the crews of foreign ships. The area was originally the location of the local Chinatown and still contains a Chinese school. The area originally served foreign sailors and American military personnel, but in the 1990s, with the growth of South Korea's ties with Russia and the countries of the former Soviet Union, large numbers of Russian-speaking traders and migrants arrived. This led to the emergence of cafes, shops, and services with Cyrillic signage.
Haedong Yonggung temple is one of three sacred places related to the Goddess Buddha.
Gamcheon Cultural Village was created in the 1950s as a residential community along a mountain slope. The houses in the village are built in a staircase fashion. The village often dubbed the "Machu Picchu of Korea" attracts many tourists. In addition, the village received a special mention during the 3rd edition of the international award ceremony, "UCLG-MEXICO CITY-Culture 21".

Busan Citizens Park (formerly Camp Hialeah) is a former Imperial Japanese Army base and United States Army camp located in the Busanjin District.
Huinnyeoul Culture Village was created when Korean War refugees flocked to this area. It provides an unhindered view of both the Busanhang and Namhang Ports. A major backdrop of the 2013 film The Attorney, the neighborhood was also featured in the 2012 film Nameless Gangster: Rules of the Time. The small houses that stand shoulder to shoulder form the signature look of Busan, which is often remembered as a city of the sea and hilly neighborhoods. The village continues to attract an increasing number of visitors with its new cafes, workshops, and guesthouses.
Millac Waterfront Park is the first waterfront park in Korea, combines the oceanfront with public leisure facilities. The park is located between Haeundae Beach and Gwangalli Beach. The waterfront park, with an area of 33,507m², can accommodate as many as 40,000 visitors. The floor of the park is decorated with colorful blocks, and the park provides visitors a perfect chance to relax and features flower gardens, gazebos and benches. If you sit on the 3,040–wide stand, you can dip your feet in the water during high tide.
Nampo-dong is a central shopping and café district. The area around Pukyong National University and Kyungsung University also has many cafés, bars, and restaurants attracting college students and youth.
With a length of 7.62 km (4.73 mi) and a size of 2.66 km2 (1.03 sq mi), designated as Natural Monument No. 179, Daejeo Ecological Park is a habitat for migratory birds at the Nakdong River Estuary. The estuary was chosen as a trial project for the Four Major Rivers Restoration Project. The sports facilities were partially built on the upper and lower parts of the park only, while the rest of the park underwent a restoration of its wetlands and natural grassland. In the garden inside the park, you can find a large-scale habitat for prickly water lilies, which are part of the Endangered Species Level II classification. Many interesting festivals, such as the Nakdong Riverside Cherry Blossom Festival, the Busan Nakdong River Canola Flower Festival, and the Daejeo Tomato Festival are held around this park every year.
Ilgwang Beach is a long white-sand beach, extending for about 1.8 kilometers, and is particularly popular among families with young children as a vacation spot because the waters are quite shallow. Every summer, the Gaetmaeul Outdoor Drama Festival is held on this beach. The festival features diverse performances of traditional Korean music, outdoor dramas, mime shows, and other performance art forms.
Kiswire Museum offers its visitors a chance to better understand wire, a key material for industrial development, and central to Kiswire's corporate philosophy. The museum won the 2014 Busan Architecture Award for its aesthetic design. In addition, the roof of the museum is supported by only 38 cables without any pillars or beams, which makes the museum quite unique. In addition, the museum features special art pieces, including artwork made with wires.
Jeonpo Café Street in Seomyeon, Busan is one of the busiest areas, with a variety of entertainment, restaurants, and stores. Across Seomyeon 1 Beonga (Seomyeon 1st Street), the busiest street in the area, there is a quiet and tranquil street with about 30 unique cafés. The Bujeon-dong and Jeonpo-dong areas were full of hardware stores and machine part suppliers, but since 2010 the area has been transformed into a street full of cafés.
Busan is planning to build the first floating city in the world. So-called Oceanix City will be finished and ready for settlement by 2025.

=== Traditional cuisine ===
Busan was once a center of military affairs in the southern region of the peninsula and therefore was an important site for diplomatic relationships with Japan; high-ranking officers and officials from the court frequently visited the city. Special foods were prepared for the officers such as Dongnae pajeon (동래파전), a variant of pajeon (Korean savory pancakes), made with whole scallions, sliced chili peppers, and various kinds of seafood in a thick batter of wheat flour, glutinous rice flour, eggs, salt and water.
During the Korean War, Busan was the biggest refugee destination on the peninsula; people from all regions of Korea went there. Some of these refugees stayed and adapted the recipes of their local specialties. One of these foods is milmyeon (밀면) (lit. 'wheat noodle') a version of naengmyeon, cold buckwheat noodle soup, but using wheat flour instead. (Naengmyeon is originally a specialty food of Hamhung and Pyongyang, now part of North Korea.) Dwaeji gukbap (돼지국밥) (lit. 'pork/pig soup rice') is also a result of Korean War. It is a hearty pork soup and is becoming more popular nationwide. Pork trotters served with vegetables such as cucumbers, onions, and mustard sauce is popular and is called Nangchae-Jokbal.


=== Hot spring resorts and spas ===
Busan has the largest hot spring resorts and facilities in Korea. Busan's Oncheon is the oldest hot spring spa in Korea.

=== Media ===


=== In popular culture ===
Although Seoul remains the de facto film and television capital of South Korea, Busan shares more in common with Cannes, France than just its reputation as seaside resort town.
The Busan International Film Festival is often referred to as the "Cannes of Asia", attracting thousands of entertainment personalities from both Eastern and Western cinema every year, honoring and recognizing international luminaries such as Mike Leigh, Shōhei Imamura, Wong Kar-wai, and Kim Ki-duk.
It is frequently used as a film location, best known in the west for Marvel's Black Panther and Apple's Pachinko, but also for the Korean market productions of Train to Busan, Old Boy, and Decision to Leave, as well as the popular K-Drama Reply 1997, highlighting the distinct 
Gyeongsang dialect, which is comparable to a Scottish English in relation to standard British English.
Works set in Busan tend to be crime noirs. Additionally, Busan often appears as an escape location or disaster area. Stories where characters escape to Busan to flee accidents or disasters in Seoul and then escape overseas are quite common clichés in Korean disaster films. Train to Busan carries out an escape to Busan, as the title suggests.
Until the late 1990s, most dramas, movies, commercials, and music videos were filmed in the Seoul area, making filming outside Seoul quite rare. In the early 2000s, it was relatively easy to obtain permits for road closures and explosion scenes in Busan that would have been impossible in Seoul. Thanks to active support from the city, word of mouth started in the film industry, leading to a preference for filming in the Busan area. In particular, the film Haeundae was a box office success, achieving 10 million viewers.


== Demographics ==

Between 1945 and 1951, the city's population grew from 280,000 to 840,000. It decreased from 3,513,777 in 2015 to 3,266,598 in 2024. This decline, which accelerated in the 1990s, is attributed to South Korea's economic shift towards high-tech industries, concentrated around Seoul, and away from Busan's traditional manufacturing base.


=== Religion ===

In 2024, 29% followed Buddhism and 21% followed Christianity (14% Protestantism and 7% Catholicism), and 2% other religions. 48% of the population is irreligious.


== Sports ==
The city planned to bid for the 2020 Summer Olympics, but withdrew after the 2018 Winter Olympics were awarded to Pyeongchang, also located in South Korea. The 2020 Summer Olympics were eventually awarded to Tokyo. It considered bidding to host the 2032 Summer Olympics.
Within domestic sports, Busan gained a reputation as something of a "cursed city". While the term "sports curse" is not commonly used in Korean, the failures of its local teams during the 2000s and 2010s have been well-documented and their long-suffering passionate fans often been humorously highlighted by the media. KBO League team Lotte Giants have not won a Korean Series title since the 1990s while K League original member Daewoo Royals (later Busan IPark) went through ownership changes and was relegated to the second division in 2015, ending over three decades in the top division. The last time a Busan team had won a title was in 1997, when Kia won the inaugural KBL Championship and Daewoo Royals won the K League title. Professional basketball teams Busan KCC Egis (men) and Busan BNK Sum (women) ended the drought in 2024 and 2025 respectively by winning their respective championships, the latter becoming the first ever Busan-based franchise to win its championship title at home and coincidentally with a Busan native as its head coach. Such was the significance of Busan KCC Egis's win that it gained extensive national media coverage and the Championship-winning team was personally honored by the Mayor.
Sports teams and facilities


=== Baseball ===

Since 1982, the city has been home to the Lotte Giants, who play in the Korea Professional Baseball league. In Korea, Busan is known as the capital of baseball and has a reputation for very enthusiastic baseball fans. For the first few years, the Lotte Giants utilized Gudeok Baseball Stadium as their home. In the mid-1980s, they moved to Sajik Baseball Stadium, which was built as part of a sports complex for the 1986 Asian Games.


=== Football ===
The city is home to a K League football club, the Busan IPark. The club was formerly known as the Busan Daewoo Royals and was a successful team during the 1990s. Busan is also home to a K3 League football club, the Busan Transportation Corporation.


=== Basketball ===
Sajik Arena is the city's basketball venue and is shared by both Korean Basketball League and Women's Korean Basketball League teams. It is currently home to Busan KCC Egis (KBL) and Busan BNK Sum (WKBL). Busan BNK Sum previously used the Geumjeong Gymnasium from 2019 to 2021 before moving to Sajik Arena. KBL franchises that formerly used Sajik Arena include KT Sonicboom (moved to Suwon) and Kia Enterprise (moved to Ulsan and became Ulsan Hyundai Mobis Phoebus).


=== 2002 FIFA World Cup ===
