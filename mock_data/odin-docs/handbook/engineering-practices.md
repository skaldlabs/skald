# Engineering Practices

## Development Philosophy

At Odin, we build reliable, scalable, and maintainable systems that delight our users and empower our content creators. Our engineering practices balance innovation with stability.

## Core Principles

### 1. User-Centric Development
- Every feature should serve a clear user need
- Performance matters: target <2s page loads
- Accessibility is non-negotiable (WCAG 2.1 AA minimum)
- Mobile-first design approach

### 2. Code Quality
- Code should be readable and self-documenting
- Prefer simple solutions over clever ones
- Write tests for critical paths
- Review your own PRs before requesting reviews from others

### 3. Iterative Improvement
- Ship small, ship often
- Gather feedback early
- Iterate based on data and user feedback
- Embrace continuous improvement

### 4. Knowledge Sharing
- Document architectural decisions
- Share learnings in team demos
- Mentor junior developers
- Contribute to internal tech blog

### 5. Code Review Guidelines

**As an Author:**
- Provide context in PR description
- Highlight areas needing extra attention
- Respond to feedback gracefully
- Ask questions if feedback is unclear
- Thank reviewers for their time

**As a Reviewer:**
- Be kind and constructive
- Explain the "why" behind suggestions
- Distinguish between "must fix" and "nice to have"
- Approve with minor comments if appropriate
- Use GitHub suggestions for small changes
- Focus on logic, readability, and maintainability

**Review Focus Areas:**
- Correctness: Does it solve the problem?
- Design: Is the approach sound?
- Tests: Adequate coverage and quality?
- Readability: Can others understand it?
- Security: Any vulnerabilities?
- Performance: Any concerns?
- Documentation: Is it clear?

## Testing Standards

### Test Pyramid
- **70% Unit Tests**: Fast, isolated, test single functions/classes
- **20% Integration Tests**: Test component interactions
- **10% E2E Tests**: Critical user journeys

### Coverage Requirements
- Minimum 80% code coverage for new code
- 100% coverage for critical paths (auth, payments, data integrity)
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Don't write tests just for coverage metrics

### Testing Best Practices
- Write tests before fixing bugs
- Use meaningful test names: `test_user_cannot_access_other_users_data`
- Keep tests independent and isolated
- Mock external dependencies
- Test behavior, not implementation details
- Use factories and fixtures for test data

### Types of Tests

**Unit Tests:**
```python
def test_calculate_lesson_progress():
    """Test lesson progress calculation with various completion states"""
    completed_lessons = [1, 2, 3]
    total_lessons = 10

    progress = calculate_progress(completed_lessons, total_lessons)

    assert progress == 30.0
```

**Integration Tests:**
```python
async def test_user_enrollment_flow():
    """Test complete user enrollment in a course"""
    user = await create_user()
    course = await create_course()

    enrollment = await enroll_user(user.id, course.id)

    assert enrollment.user_id == user.id
    assert enrollment.status == "active"
    assert enrollment.progress == 0
```

**E2E Tests:**
```typescript
test('user can complete a mythology quiz', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('/courses/norse-mythology')
  await page.click('text=Start Quiz')

  // Answer questions
  await page.click('[data-testid="answer-1"]')
  await page.click('text=Next')

  // Verify results
  await expect(page.locator('.quiz-score')).toContainText('100%')
})
```

## Code Style

### Python
- Follow PEP 8
- Use Black for formatting
- Use mypy for type checking
- Maximum line length: 100 characters
- Use type hints for function signatures

```python
from typing import Optional, List

def get_user_courses(
    user_id: int,
    status: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: int = 10
) -> List[Course]:
    """
    Retrieve courses for a user with optional filtering.

    Args:
        user_id: The ID of the user
        status: Optional course status filter (e.g., 'active', 'completed')
        limit: Maximum number of courses to return

    Returns:
        List of Course objects

    Raises:
        UserNotFoundError: If user_id doesn't exist
    """
    # Implementation
    pass
```

### TypeScript/JavaScript
- Follow Airbnb style guide
- Use ESLint and Prettier
- Prefer functional components and hooks
- Use TypeScript for type safety

```typescript
interface UserCourse {
  id: string
  userId: string
  courseId: string
  progress: number
  status: 'active' | 'completed' | 'paused'
}

interface GetUserCoursesParams {
  userId: string
  status?: 'active' | 'completed' | 'paused'
  limit?: number
}

async function getUserCourses({
  userId,
  status,
  limit = 10,
}: GetUserCoursesParams): Promise<UserCourse[]> {
  // Implementation
}
```

### General Guidelines
- Use descriptive variable names
- Keep functions small and focused (max 50 lines)
- Avoid deep nesting (max 3 levels)
- Comment "why" not "what"
- Delete commented-out code (that's what git is for)

## Performance

### Frontend Performance
- Lazy load routes and components
- Optimize images (WebP format, responsive sizes)
- Minimize bundle size (<300KB initial load)
- Use React.memo and useMemo strategically
- Implement virtual scrolling for long lists
- Prefetch critical resources

### Backend Performance
- Use database indexes appropriately
- Implement caching (Redis) for frequently accessed data
- Paginate large result sets
- Use database connection pooling
- Optimize N+1 queries
- Monitor and optimize slow queries (>100ms)

### Performance Budgets
- First Contentful Paint: <1.8s
- Time to Interactive: <3.8s
- Lighthouse Score: >90
- API Response Time (p95): <200ms
- API Response Time (p99): <500ms

## Security

### Authentication & Authorization
- Use OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect
- Implement MFA for admin accounts
- Use JWT with short expiration times
- Validate all user input
- Follow principle of least privilege

### Data Protection
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest
- Use HTTPS everywhere
- Sanitize user input to prevent XSS
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Implement rate limiting
- Log security events

### Dependencies
- Keep dependencies up-to-date
- Run security audits weekly (`npm audit`, `pip-audit`)
- Review dependency licenses
- Minimize dependency count

### Security Checklist
- [ ] Input validation on all user data
- [ ] Output encoding to prevent XSS
- [ ] CSRF tokens for state-changing operations
- [ ] Secure password storage (bcrypt, argon2)
- [ ] SQL injection prevention
- [ ] Access control checks
- [ ] Sensitive data not logged
- [ ] API rate limiting

## Database

### Schema Design
- Use migrations for all schema changes
- Include rollback migrations
- Add indexes for foreign keys and commonly queried fields
- Use appropriate data types
- Normalize when appropriate, denormalize for performance if needed

### Migration Process
1. Create migration locally
2. Test migration and rollback
3. Review migration in PR
4. Run on staging
5. Run on production during maintenance window
6. Monitor for issues

### Query Optimization
- Use EXPLAIN ANALYZE for complex queries
- Create indexes for WHERE, JOIN, and ORDER BY columns
- Avoid SELECT *
- Use appropriate JOIN types
- Batch operations when possible

## Monitoring & Observability

### Logging
- Use structured logging (JSON format)
- Include correlation IDs for request tracing
- Log levels: DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL
- Never log sensitive data (passwords, tokens, PII)

### Metrics
- Response time (p50, p95, p99)
- Error rates
- Database query performance
- Cache hit rates
- Background job queue depth

### Alerts
- Page for critical issues (payment failures, auth down)
- Slack for warnings (increased error rate, slow queries)
- Weekly reports for trends
- On-call rotation for after-hours

### Incident Response
1. Acknowledge alert
2. Assess impact and severity
3. Mitigate (rollback, scale, hotfix)
4. Communicate to stakeholders
5. Post-mortem within 48 hours
6. Implement preventive measures
