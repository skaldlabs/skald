# Security Policy

## Security at Odin

Security is everyone's responsibility. We handle sensitive user data, payment information, and proprietary content—protecting these is critical to maintaining user trust and our business.

## Security Principles

### 1. Defense in Depth
Multiple layers of security controls to protect against threats.

### 2. Least Privilege
Grant minimum access necessary to perform job functions.

### 3. Zero Trust
Never trust, always verify—even inside our network.

### 4. Security by Design
Build security into products from the start, not as an afterthought.

### 5. Transparency
Be open about security practices with users and within the company.
