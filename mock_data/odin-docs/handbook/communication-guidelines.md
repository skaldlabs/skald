# Communication Guidelines

## Communication Philosophy

Effective communication is the foundation of our remote-friendly, international team. We value transparency, clarity, and thoughtfulness in all our interactions.

## Core Principles

### 1. Default to Transparency
- Share information openly unless there's a specific reason not to
- Make decisions visible and well-documented
- Use public channels instead of DMs when appropriate
- Document "why" behind decisions

### 2. Asynchronous First
- Respect time zones and working hours
- Write clear, complete messages
- Don't expect immediate responses
- Use synchronous communication when truly needed

### 3. Be Considerate
- Assume positive intent
- Think before you send
- Re-read your messages from the recipient's perspective
- Be mindful of cultural and language differences

### 4. Clarity Over Cleverness
- Be direct and specific
- Provide context
- Use simple language
- Avoid jargon and acronyms unless well-known

## Communication Channels

### Slack

**Primary uses:**
- Day-to-day communication
- Quick questions and updates
- Team coordination
- Social connection

**Channel Structure:**
- `#general`: Company-wide announcements
- `#engineering`, `#design`, `#content`, etc.: Department channels
- `#help-*`: Get help from specific teams
- `#random`: Social chat and fun
- `#wins`: Celebrate achievements
- Project-specific channels: `#project-name`

**Best Practices:**

✅ **Do:**
- Use threads to keep conversations organized
- Use @channel and @here sparingly (only for urgent, everyone needs to know)
- Update your status to show availability
- Use emoji reactions to acknowledge messages
- Search before asking questions
- Share links to documents instead of screenshots of text
- Set reminders for follow-ups

❌ **Don't:**
- Send "hi" and wait for response—include your question
- DM when a channel would be more appropriate
- Use @everyone (restricted to admins)
- Edit messages after someone has replied (can confuse conversation)
- Expect immediate responses outside working hours
- Have important discussions in DMs (document in public channels)

**Response Time Expectations:**
- Urgent (with @mention during working hours): Within 2 hours
- Normal messages: Within 24 hours
- Non-urgent: 48 hours
- Outside working hours: No expectation

**Status Guide:**
- 🟢 Available
- 🟡 In a meeting (will respond later)
- 🔴 Do not disturb
- 🏖️ On vacation
- 🏠 Working from home
- Custom: "Deep focus until 3pm", "In timezone: GMT+1"

### Email

**When to use:**
- Formal communication
- External communication
- Detailed information requiring documentation
- When threading/organization is important
- Communication with non-technical stakeholders

**Best Practices:**
- Clear, specific subject lines
- Key information in first paragraph
- Use bullet points for clarity
- Include clear next steps or calls to action
- CC appropriately, BCC rarely
- Response time: 24-48 hours

**Email Etiquette:**
```
Subject: [Clear, specific subject] - [Action needed/FYI]

Hi [Name],

[Context in 1-2 sentences]

[Main message with key points]

Next steps:
- [Action item 1 - Owner - Due date]

[Your name]
```

### General Writing

**Be Clear:**

**Be Complete:**
- Provide context
- Include links to relevant resources
- Anticipate questions
- Specify next steps

**Be Concise:**
- Respect people's time
- Edit before sending
- Remove unnecessary words
- Get to the point

**Examples:**

❌ **Unclear:**
> "Hey, just checking in on the thing we talked about. Any updates?"

✅ **Clear:**
> "Hi @Sarah, following up on the Norwegian language course redesign we discussed on Monday. Could you share an update on the prototype by Friday? This will help us stay on track for the Feb 15 launch."

### Technical Writing

- Use proper terminology
- Provide examples
- Link to documentation
- Include screenshots/diagrams when helpful
- Explain the "why" not just the "what"
- Consider different skill levels

### Announcements

**Structure:**
```
## What's Changing
[Clear description of the change]

## Why
[Rationale and context]

## When
[Timeline and dates]

## Impact
[Who is affected and how]

## Next Steps
[What people need to do]

## Questions?
[Where to get more info]
```

## Giving Feedback

### Principles
- Be timely (feedback within a week)
- Be specific with examples
- Focus on behavior, not person
- Assume positive intent
- Provide actionable suggestions
- Balance positive and constructive
- Consider cultural differences in feedback styles

### SBI Framework

**Situation:** Describe the when and where
**Behavior:** Describe the observable behavior
**Impact:** Explain the impact it had

Example:
> "In yesterday's team meeting (Situation), when you interrupted Sarah multiple times while she was presenting the roadmap (Behavior), it made it difficult for her to complete her thoughts and may have discouraged her from sharing ideas (Impact). In future meetings, I'd suggest waiting for natural pauses to ask questions."

### Receiving Feedback

- Listen without defensiveness
- Ask clarifying questions
- Thank the person for feedback
- Reflect before responding
- Act on feedback when appropriate

## Cross-Cultural Communication

### Time Zones

- Always specify timezone (use UTC or local with TZ)
- Use tools like World Time Buddy
- Rotate meeting times for fairness
- Record meetings for those in difficult timezones
- Be flexible with async communication

### Language Differences

- Use clear, simple language
- Avoid idioms and colloquialisms
- Check understanding
- Be patient with non-native speakers
- Use translation tools when helpful
- Clarify rather than assume

### Cultural Differences

- Direct vs. indirect communication styles vary
- Feedback norms differ across cultures
- Hierarchy expectations differ
- Be curious and ask questions
- Educate yourself on team members' cultures
- When in doubt, be more formal/polite

## Communication in Different Situations

### Sharing Updates

**Project Updates:**

- What's next
- Blockers or concerns
- Help needed
- Timeline status

**Personal Updates:**
- Use Slack status for availability

### Asking Questions

**Before asking:**

- Check if answer exists

**When asking:**
- Provide context
- Show what you've tried
- Be specific
- Ask in appropriate channel
- Share solution when found (help others)

**Good question format:**
```
I'm working on [context]. I'm trying to [goal].

I've tried:
- [Thing 1]
- [Thing 2]

I'm getting [specific error/issue].

Expected: [what should happen]
Actual: [what is happening]

[Relevant links, screenshots, code]
```

### Disagreements

- Assume positive intent
- Focus on ideas, not people
- Listen to understand, not to respond
- Acknowledge valid points
- Use "yes, and..." instead of "yes, but..."
- Escalate if needed
- Agree to disagree if necessary
- Document decisions

### Escalation

**When to escalate:**
- Repeated issues despite addressing
- Urgent issues requiring leadership

- Policy violations
- Security concerns

**How to escalate:**
1. Try to resolve directly first
2. Document the issue and attempts to resolve
3. Reach out to manager or appropriate person
4. Provide context and proposed solutions
5. Follow up on resolution
